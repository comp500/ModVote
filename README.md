# Mod Vote
Enjoyed the mob vote? Why not also vote on your favourite mods in the 23w13a_or_b snapshot, and have them be automatically added to your game! Just stick the mods you want to vote on in the `modvotemods` folder.

Requires Quilt Loader 0.19.0-beta.7 or newer, and the JVM argument `-Dloader.experimental.allow_loading_plugins=true`.

Currently not functional serverside! Please do not rely on this to work (it uses an experimental API and runs on a joke snapshot!!) and do not cry if all your mods are disabled and all the blocks they added get removed!!
